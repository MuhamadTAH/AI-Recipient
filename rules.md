# Rules

1. Before doing anything give me your plan to know if I like it or not.
2. Do not make everything in one go - do it step by step and after each step tell me what I need to see and give you permission to the next step.
3. Make a claude.md file and save what our plan is that we want to do and after doing each step mention that we did the step.
4. Push the code to GitHub because I run the server in Render. Repository URL: https://github.com/MuhamadTAH/AI-Recipient.git - delete existing code then push new code there.
